# calculator-cucumber

This repository contains Java 11 code for computing arithmetic expressions.
It is deliberately incomplete as it serves to be the basis of all kinds of extensions,
such as a more sophisticated Calculator application.

The example code is accompanied by an incomplete set of JUnit 4 unit tests.
The example code is accompanied by an incomplete set of Cucumber BDD tests, also running in Junit.

The code and tests are executable with Maven.

The code was written by Tom Mens in January 2021 for educational purposes.
