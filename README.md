# calculator-cucumber

This repository contains Java 11 code for computing arithmetic expressions.
It is deliberately incomplete as it serves to be the basis of all kinds of extensions,
such as a more sophisticated Calculator application.

The example code is accompanied by an set of JUnit 5 unit tests.
The example code is accompanied by an set of Cucumber BDD scenarios, also running in Junit.

The tests and scenarios are executable with Maven using "mvn test".

The code was written by Tom Mens in January 2021 for educational purposes.
